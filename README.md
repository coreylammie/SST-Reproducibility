Supplementary GitHub Repository containing code to reproduce results from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3[A-B] from *A General Metal Oxide ReRAM Device Endurance and Retention Model for Large-scale Simulations*, which has been submitted to IEEE Electron Device Letters.

## Abstract
Metal-Oxide Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) devices are a class of memristors, that when arranged in crossbar configurations, can perform in-memory computing, which has shown great promise to augment the performance of Machine Learning (ML) and neuromorphic architectures. However, these devices face concerns of device failure and non-idealities, which greatly inhibits their performance and usability. In this letter, we propose a novel computationally efficient generalized Metal Oxide ReRAM endurance and retention model for use in large-scale simulations. We compare it to related works, demonstrate its versatility by fitting it to experimental data from various fabricated devices, and use it within large-scale simulations with a Memristive Deep Neural Network (MDNN) determining performance using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
